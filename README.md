# Racing-Tracks

Purpose of this project was to create 3 different car race levels in Unity. 
Every level contains lap with start, half way check point, finish line and obstacles.
Difficulty is raising with each level. Car slows down on grass and speeds up on the bridge. 
Game also has a timer - it saves your best time on every lap.

Thanks to this project I was able to explore interesting new tool in Unity - **Splines** - I used them as race laps.
I had lot of fun trying to create aesthetic UI experience. 


Below is short presentation of the game.
